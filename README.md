# Introduction

This repository contains the code for the experiments described in the paper [VIKING: Deep variational inference with stochastic projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23684).

ðŸ’¡ If you're interested in building on top of the method described in the paper, we have also released [a library](https://github.com/fadel/viking) for that use case!

## Getting started

The following will install a package with most of the paper code and its dependencies.

```commandline
pip install .
```

To use an editable installation, where you can also edit the code within the `vp` module and immediately see the changes, run:

```commandline
pip install -e .
```

"Editable" means that one doesn't have to reinstall after changing the source, which is typically easier when writing Python modules.

## How to run the code

Once the package is in your Python environment, check for scripts in the `experiments/` subdirectory. They support a `--help` argument with instructions on how to run them.
